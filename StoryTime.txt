1. Jack flew into the Flughafen in Berlin for a vacation. 
2. When he arrived, he saw a Rammstein playing music in lederhosen.
3. He was hungry after seeing the band, so he drove on the haupstrasse to try and find a baeckerei.
4. Jack found a quaint baeckerei and ate four delicious gebaeck.
5. Jack couldn't finish the final gebaeck, so he gave the last of it to his hund.
